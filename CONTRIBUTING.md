# Contributing to the bacon-chainsaw Repository

All users are welcome to contribute. I am currently new to Git and GitHub, and 
especially new to handling other users pull requests. It hoped that this repository
will help those who are looking to get better at GitHub and for me on handling your
pull requests. Thanks for dropping by.

This helps me to better understand how to handle pull requests.
